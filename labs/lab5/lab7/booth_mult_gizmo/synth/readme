This directory is where synthesis is done.

Symbolic links should be made to the source files in the rtl directory.
This ensures that you are synthesizing the current version.

This directory is ready for use with Quartus according to the procedure
outlined below for a new project.

The qsf file here is a generic constraints file that maps the
pins for the Gizmo board.

The qpf file is the corresponding Quartus project file.

To use these files for a new project.  Put the qsf and qpf files in
the directory with your source.  You must have at least the file called
wrapper10k100.v as this is assumed in the qsf and qpf files.
1) Start up Quartus.
2) Open up the project.
3) If you have additional source files, use Project-->Add/Remove files.


To use the pin constraints for an existing project:
1) Exit Quartus if you are running it.
2) In the existing project, there should be a qsf file already.
2) Edit the qsf file and paste in the Pin & Location Assignments
	section of the generic qsf file in this directory.
3) You may also need to add in the Analysis & Synthesis Assignments
	section and the Fitter Assignments section to use the correct device.
4) Start up Quartus and open the project.  The pins should now be
	constrained in the project.
