wrapper10k100.v		The wrapper file that is provided with mytop
			instantiated.  It contains all of the pin
			definitions.  The corresponding constraints
			file is found in the synth directory.

mytop.v			This is a top-level file that was created because
			wrapper10k100.v does not use a naming convention
			that makes sense.  I was getting very confused about
			the proper use of each signal, so I defined a new
			"top-level" file that just gets inserted in the
			wrapper file.

bus_controller.v	This is a controller that works on the 68K bus.
			It provides the interface to the Booth multiplier
			block.

booth.v			This is a simple sequential multiplier block that
			uses Booth bit-pair recoding.

LEDA_WORK		The Synopsys LEDA linter was used.  All other
			generated files were deleted for this distribution.
