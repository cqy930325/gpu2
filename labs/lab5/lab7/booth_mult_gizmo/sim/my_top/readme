This is essentially the top-level simulation that puts the
bus controller and multiplier together.

Simulation was done with Modelsim via the script files shown here.

After compiling the source files:

do init.do	Initializes a few things
do mults.do	Runs a bunch of test inputs

init+mults.wlf	Waveform file created by running init.do and mults.do
		from time 0.
