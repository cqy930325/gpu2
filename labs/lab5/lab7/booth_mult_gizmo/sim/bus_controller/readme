This is the simulation of just the bus controller.

Simulation was done with Modelsim via the script files shown here.

After compiling the source files:

do init.do	Initializes a few things
do rwregs.do	Runs a bunch of test inputs

init+rwregs.wlf	Waveform file created by running init.do and rwregs.do
		from time 0.
